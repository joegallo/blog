# Here Strings

I just learned very recently that you can use `<<<` as a "Here
String". I'd always used `echo` for that in the past, which felt a
little gross.

```bash
joegallo@radiant:~ $ export X="foo bar baz"
joegallo@radiant:~ $ echo $X | sed "s/bar/quux/g"
foo quux baz
joegallo@radiant:~ $ sed "s/bar/quux/g" <<< $X
foo quux baz
```
